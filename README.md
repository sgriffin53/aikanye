Verse 1: Kanye West

All the street lights, glowing, happen to be
Her love is all that I can see
No matter how much of a thug you see
I've been afflicted by not one, not two, but all three
I got the right, to put up a fight
At the studio console, asked my man to the right
'Cause I, I look to the light
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?

Verse 2: Kanye West

By myself wondering how I'm gonna get through the day
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
Run away from me, baby, ah, run away
And I'm sad, when Rosie goes away
Ja make them so sunny and true
I don't want to drop your friends off, I just want you
Anyway, they don't know you like I do
How do I bind you?

Chorus: Kanye West and Justin Vernon
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
Two words, Mos Def, Black Jack, hot shit
Game 'pon lock shit, gun 'pon cock shit
Yeah I'mma stop killing these niggas soon as the chorus hit
See I done did all this ol' bullshit
'Specially in my Pastell√©, on my Bape shit
On that independent shit
We took that shit, measured it and then cooked that shit

Verse 3: Kanye West & Ant Clemons

Eye of the law, aspire for more
Let's call out names, names, I hate you, more
Let's call out names, names, I hate you more
So good night, I'm headed out the door
And my niggas said I shouldn't let it worry me
Niggas ain't real as they pretend to be
You're gonna be the death of me
They take me to the back and pat me
